# FEED ME

**Making Meal Planning Easier**

Feed me is a fully interactive meal plan app that gives you an accurate grocery list for the whole week's prep. The user uses their login to allow storage of their weekly schedule. Choosing through a library of recipes, they apply the meal to the day and time they want and stores the schedule in the database.

## Motivation

This app was created to help the busy modern family have healthy and delicious home cooked meals. The grocery list helps for a one time shopping list so that the house has all the ingredients needed to sustain a fully prepped week.

## How to use?

Once a user has signed up or logged in, they are redirected to the homepage where they can begin searching for meals and recipes they desire. Recipes are presented as feature items but the user can input a search key to have a more refined list of recipes to filter through. As the user finds a recipe they desire they navigate to the recipe section and can choose from a dropdown list which day they'd like to add the meal to, and which meal. The meal is then loaded into the mealplan calendar.
By clicking on the "Grocery List" the user is navigated to the complete list of ingredients of all the meals in the calendar combined, allowing for a single simple list that can be given to any willing husband.
